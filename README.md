accelerometerApp
================

App to automatically determine the floor you parked out. GPS is not helpful, so we use the accelerometers to judge how many times you've turned.

    Goals:
        xRead sensors
        xRecord sensors
        /Graphical View
          Also collect data while in the graph activity
        Run only when in parking garage
            Subgoals to achieve this:
                Run in background
                GPS/BT to trigger it on and off
        xExport data
        Pattern analyze
            Is acc or jerk the best descriptor? Record both for now
            Try with compass data instead?
        Hardcode the pattern
        Record history of parking location/times
        Widget to show most recent floor
